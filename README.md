# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing
To ensure the safety and reliability of every unique car configuration before they hit the road, the company’s engineers have developed a robust testing system. As one of the world’s biggest manufacturers of premium cars, safety and efficiency are paramount on Mercedes-Benz’s production lines. However, optimizing the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming without a powerful algorithmic approach.  Our goal is to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench.
